CSC180 Labs and Projects

Just all of my projects and labs from this course. Some of the files and/or lines of code are directly from the assignment
materials, so I would assume my prof wrote them. Otherwise, they should be my own :). Some of these took me some time, but
they should all run and not have memory leaks hehe.

I wish there was something cool in this course.

PS: if you are a first year engsci, please don't steal my code. It will probably get both of us in trouble.
